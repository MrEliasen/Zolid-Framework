##Zolid-RPG - 0.0.1
The Zolid-RPG project is a "Just For Fun" project where I try different types of coding techniques and structures. I thought I would make it Open Source in case anyone could benefit from it. Once version 0.0.1 is available I will setup a forum where people can share snippets and so on.
