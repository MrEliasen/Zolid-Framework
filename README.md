##Zolid Framework - 0.1.6.0
MVC based PHP framework which allows you to very quickly build a website which requires a user system (login, signup, password reset etc.). It comes packed with a lot of security features to help protect against CSRF, XSS, Session Hijacking and more, which is easy to implement.

##Feedback
If you do not mind, I would love to hear from you if you think parts of the code can be improved in any way as I always love to get feedback and become a better developer.<br>
You can do this by contributing to this repo or by contacting me directly.<br>
Thanks in advance!
