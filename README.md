##Zolid Framework - 0.2.0.1
MVC based PHP framework which allows you to very quickly build/deploy a website which requires a user system (login, signup, password reset etc.). It comes packed with a lot of security features to help protect against CSRF, XSS, Session Hijacking and more, which is easy to implement. Since 0.2.0.0, there is now a plugin system which allow you to add functionality to your system without modifying the core system!

##Feedback
